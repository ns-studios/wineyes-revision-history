Welcome to Window-Eyes 5.5 

Congratulations! 

You are about to experience the cutting edge leader in screen access technology: Window-Eyes 5.5. 

### Installation 

When installing Window-Eyes 5.5 (as well as any future upgrade), you will be asked if you want to make a backup of your existing set files. If you choose yes, the Window-Eyes installation will default the Path edit box to a location of x:webackup (where x: is the drive letter where Window-Eyes is currently installed). You may, however, enter a path in the Path edit box manually, or select a different location using the Directories tree view provided. Note that you should not choose your Window-Eyes directory as a location for backing up your set files, as that directory will be removed if Window-Eyes is ever uninstalled. If you choose no to the backup prompt, no backup of your existing set files will be created. 

### Microsoft Excel 

The following section deals with the specific Excel features that Window-Eyes 5.5 now supports. As you will discover, there are many new features available. 

#### The Microsoft Excel DOM (Document Object Model) 

Window-Eyes 5.5 uses the Microsoft Excel DOM (Document Object Model) to communicate directly with Excel (much like the Microsoft Word DOM support in Window-Eyes 5.0), insuring a robust and accurate environment when navigating through Excel spreadsheets. 

#### Cell Navigation 

When you navigate through cells in Excel, either with the dedicated arrow keys, or with TAB and SHIFT-TAB, you may hear a lot of information (depending on the format and contents of the cell that you have navigated to, as well as your verbosity options, discussed below), such as Cell Data, Cell Position, and Additional Options. 

If a cell contains data, by default, Window-Eyes will read that data as you move from cell to cell. If a cell does not contain data, Window-Eyes will not read anything for the contents. You can, however, use the Blank Lines option from the Screen menu to have Window-Eyes say �blank� when it encounters a cell with no data. 

#### Verbosity 

Window-Eyes 5.5 includes a new verbosity group in the Window-Eyes Verbosity Settings dialog, accessed by pressing the Verbosity Settings hot key (INS-V by default). Note that when you press the Verbosity Settings hot key while in Excel, the Excel verbosity group will be selected automatically. The Excel verbosity group contains four elements: Cell Information, Miscellaneous, Selection, and Summary. 

Cell Information: This information will be announced when navigating through the cells of a worksheet with either the dedicated arrow keys, or TAB and SHIFT-TAB. 

* Contents (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the contents of the current cell. 
* Never Speak Position/Always Speak Position/Speak Position If No Header (Default: Speak Position If No Header) � With the Never Speak Position setting enabled, Window-Eyes will not speak the current cell position. With the Allow Speak Position setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the current cell position. With the Speak Position If No Header setting is enabled, Window-Eyes will only speak the current cell position if no cell header is found. 
* Speak Position Before Contents (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the position of the current cell before speaking the current cell contents. 
* Formula (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak "has formula" if the current cell contains a formula. 
* Comment (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak "has comment" if the current cell contains a comment. 
* Hyperlink (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak "has hyperlink" if the current cell contains a hyperlink. 
* Clipped (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak " clipped" if the surrounding cells clip the data in the current cell. 
* Wrapped (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak " wrapped" if the cell's contents have been wrapped, spanning more than one line. 
* Overlaps (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the number of cells to the left and right that the current cell overlaps, such as "overlaps 5 right" or "overlaps 3 left" or "overlaps 5 right, 3 left." 
* Merged (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the number of merged cells by indicating the total number of rows and columns contained in the current cell, such as "merged 3 columns, 2 rows". 
* Shrunk (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak "shrunk to fit" when the contents of a cell have been decreased in size in order to fit inside the current cell boundary. 
* Affects Cells (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak "affects cells" when the current cell's value is used in a formula. 
* Auto Filter (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak "auto filter" when a cell has an auto filter defined. 
* Orientation (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the rotation amount of the text in the current cell when the text has been rotated, such as "rotated 38 up" or "rotated 45 down." 
* Input Message (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the title and message of the input message when the current cell contains an input message. 
* Conditional Formatting (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak "has conditional format" when the current cell contains conditional formatting. 
* Number Format (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will describe the number format of the current cell, such as "format date" or "format percentage with two digits." 
* Border (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the border style for all sides if the current cell is styled with a border, such as "top medium slant dash" or "left thick double." 

Miscellaneous 

* Speak Worksheet Name On Focus (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the name of the Worksheet when the worksheet gains focus. 
* Speak Workbook Name On Focus (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the name of the Workbook when the workbook gains focus. 
* Inches/Centimeters/Millimeters/Points (Default: inches) � This is used to tell Window-Eyes what measurement to use when providing size information. 
* Automatically Dock Toolbars (Default: checked) � In order to ensure that text is not hidden by any of Excel's floating toolbars, Window-Eyes provides the option to automatically move the floating toolbars from the worksheet area to the toolbar area (this method is called docking). With this option enabled, Window-Eyes will automatically dock floating toolbars. This setting should be left enabled unless a floating toolbar is truly desired. 

Selection: This information will be announced when selecting cells. 

* Speak Both New Corners (Default: checked) � As you select cells, Window-Eyes can either read the single corner cell in the direction being selected, or read both corner cells in the direction being selected. 
* Speak Number of Rows and Columns (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the number of rows and columns in the current selection. 

Summary: This information will be announced when using the Speak Summary hot key (CTRL-SHIFT-S by default)

* Worksheet Count (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the number of worksheets in the current workbook. 
* Comment Count (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the total number of comments in either the current workbook, or current worksheet. 
* Hyperlink Count (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the total number of hyperlinks in either the current workbook, or current worksheet. 
* Object Count (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the total number of objects in either the current workbook, or current worksheet. 
* Chart Count (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the total number of charts in either the current workbook, or current worksheet. 
* Counts Relative To Worksheet/Counts Relative To Workbook (Default: Counts Relative to Worksheet) � With the Counts Relative To Worksheet setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak all counts relative to the current worksheet. With the Counts Relative To Workbook setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak all counts relative to the current workbook. 
* Position (Default: checked) � With this setting enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the position of the current cell. 

#### Hot Keys 

Element Properties: To display additional information about the properties of the current element, use the Element Properties hot key (INS-E by default). The Element Properties dialog can contain the following information. 

* Textual Information 
	* Contents of the cell 
	* Position of the cell 
	* Font name (Verdana, Arial, etc.) 
	* Font size (10 point, 14 point, etc.) 
	* Text color (red, green, shade of blue, etc.) 
	* Text attributes (bold, italic, double underline, etc.) 
	* Horizontal alignment 
	* Vertical alignment 
	* Number format 
	* Borders 
	* Background color 
	* Cell size 
	* Any of the Cell Information verbosity options such as formula, comment, hyperlink, etc. 
* Chart Information 
	* Area type (chart, point, legend, etc.) 
	* Chart Title (Sales Performance Chart, My Bar Graph, etc.) 
	* Chart Name (Bar Chart 10, August Pie Chart, etc.) 
	* Chart Type (3D stacked bar, etc.) 
	* Series Elements (Name, Point Count, Axis Group, Series Type, Values, etc.) 
	* Axis Elements (Number, Title, Type, Group, Scale, etc.) 
	* Advanced Information (chart size, obscured cells, border weight, fill type, etc.) 
	* There are two sections of chart information, depending on whether the main chart area has been selected, or an individual chart element. The top part of the chart information relates to just the data of the chart. Further down, you'll find a separator that says, "Advanced Information:" which provides information about the data in the chart, as well as the visual features of the chart. 
* Object Information 
	* Object Type (Picture, Ole Object, etc.) 
	* Object Text (Bitmap Image, Wave Sound, etc.) 

Page Navigation: The Page Navigation dialog (INS-TAB by default) provides the ability to quickly navigate through or review the components of a worksheet, or workbook, in one comprehensive dialog. When accessed, the title bar of the dialog will contain the number of selected element along with whether the element is being examined in the current region, worksheet, or the entire workbook. To switch between the various element groups use the available radio buttons or associated accelerators (listed below). To focus the currently selected item and/or move the selection to that item, select the Focus Item button, press ALT-F, or simply press ENTER. 

* Comments: ALT-C � Lists all comments contained in the current worksheet or workbook. 
* Hyperlinks: ALT-H � Lists all hyperlinks contained in the current worksheet or workbook. 
* Objects: ALT-J � Lists all objects contained in the current worksheet or workbook. 
* Named Areas: ALT-A � Lists all named areas contained in the current worksheet or workbook. 
* Cells in Column: ALT-E � Lists all non-empty cells contained in the current column, and their value constrained either by the current region or workbook. 
* Cells in Row: ALT-L � Lists all non-empty cells contained in the current row, and their value constrained either by the current region or workbook. 
* Page Breaks: ALT-P � Lists individual pages and their corresponding cell range for either the current worksheet or workbook. 
* Monitor Cells: ALT-N � Lists all monitor cells contained in the current worksheet or workbook. 
* Worksheets: ALT-O � Lists all worksheets contained in the current workbook. 
* Charts: ALT-T � Lists all charts contained in the current worksheet or workbook. 

The current specified area is the region that Window-Eyes will examine to find the items that you have selected. You can control the current specified area by pressing ALT-R for region, ALT-W for Worksheet (the default), or ALT-K for Workbook. When you select a specified area, all items (such as comments, hyperlinks, objects, etc.) will be relative to the specified area. Note that certain element types are not available for certain areas. For example, Cells in Column is not available for the entire workbook. 

You can also access an edit box containing Miscellaneous Information regarding the currently selected element by either tabbing to the Miscellaneous Information edit box, or by pressing ALT-I. For example with comments you get the following in the edit box: size, whether the comment is visible or hidden, what cells it obscures when it is visible and if that region is covering any non-blank cells, the cell's contents, and the full comment. With hyperlinks you get the URL. With objects, you get what cells it obscures and whether there are any non-blank cells under that. With monitor cells, you get all the individual cells for that named group along with their data. Charts also give you what cells they cover. 

The Focus Item button will give the selected element focus or make that element active. For example, if you select a comment and activate the Focus Item button, the cell containing that comment will become the active cell. 

The Selected Item button is similar to the Focus Item button in that it will give the selected element focus or make that element active. In addition, it will also select all the other cells. For example, if you select Cells in column and have selected a cell from this group, pressing the Focus Item button will cause the selected cell to become the active cell. If you press the Select Item button, the selected cell will become the active cell, and all the other cells in the column will be selected. Note that the Selected Item button is not available for all element types. 

Headers and Totals: This dialog allows you to setup what columns and/or rows should be used as either header cell and/or total cells for an area in the current worksheet (ALT-SHIFT-H by default). As you TAB through the Headers and Totals dialog, you will discover the following controls: 

Header or Total Name Edit Box � Allows you to enter a description for the currently defined item. This name is only for documentation purposes, and has no impact on the functionality of the item being defined. For example, you might enter the name "headers for yearly sales." This name is useful for determining the function of each header/total definition for the current worksheet. 

Region To Use List Box: Allows you to set the area to be used for your headers and totals definitions. This list box will always start with "current region." Regions are automatically defined by Excel based on blank rows and columns. The region that you were in when you entered the dialog would be used if you select "current region." The next item in the Region To Use list box is "full worksheet." The full worksheet option means that your entire worksheet will be used. Any named regions that exist in the current worksheet will also be listed in the regions list box. Named areas are defined by selecting a group of cells, opening Excel�s insert menu, choosing the Name pull down, and then selecting the Define option. You can then specify a name for the current selection of cells. When you select a named region, that defined region will be used. The last item in the Region To Use list box will always be "custom." The custom item allows you to manually define an area to be used for headers and/or totals. 

* Row Header Radio Button (Default: Checked): With this option enabled, the defined row(s) will be used as column headers for the specified region. 
* Column Header Radio Button (Default: Unchecked) With this option enabled, the defined column(s) will be used as row headers for the specified region. 
* Row and Column Header Radio Button (Default: Unchecked) With this option enabled, the defined row(s) and column(s) will be used as column headers and row headers for the specified region. 
* Row Total Radio Button (Default: Unchecked) With this option enabled, the defined row(s) will be used as column totals for the specified region. 
* Column Total Radio Button (Default: Unchecked) With this option enabled, the defined column(s) will be used as row totals for the specified region. 
* Row and Column Total Radio Button (Default: Unchecked) With this option enabled, the defined row(s) and column(s) will be used as column totals and row totals for the specified region. 

Always Read Header (Default: Unchecked) � When a column header is defined, the header will only be read when navigating horizontally through the specified region. When a row header is defined, the header will only be read when navigating vertically through the specified region. With this option enabled, Window-Eyes will always read the defined header, regardless of how you move through the specified region. Note this option will be disabled if you have not selected a region type of header. 


Region Cells Edit Box: Allows you to define a range of cells for the custom item in the Region To Use list box. If any other region is selected in the Region To Use list box, the range of cells used in that selected region will be displayed in this edit box, and the edit box will be read only. This item can be used in place of setting up a named region in Excel. An Excel named region, however, should be used over a Window-Eyes custom region if the region itself will be changing in size. Window-Eyes custom region is fixed to the defined size, while an Excel named region automatically adjusts as columns and rows are added or removed. 

Add Entry Button: Saves all current data to the list of Current Headers and Totals for the current worksheet. The dialog will remain open after selecting this button. 

Remove Entry Button: Removes the currently selected item in the Current Headers and Totals list box, and associated data, for the current worksheet. The dialog will remain open after selecting this button. 

OK Button: Automatically saves all current data to the list of Current Headers and Totals for the current worksheet, and closes the dialog. 

Cancel Button: Closes the dialog without saving the current entry. 

Current Headers and Totals List Box: Displays all areas that have been defined using the Headers and Totals dialog for the current worksheet in the current workbook. When the Headers and Totals dialog is accessed for the first time in a new worksheet, this list will be empty. Entries will be displayed using the text entered in the Header or Total Name edit box after an entry is added, and the defined region type will be added to the end of the name. When you select an item in the Current Headers and Totals list box, the data associated with that header or total will be displayed in the respective controls throughout the Headers and Totals dialog, allowing you to either review the settings or adjust them. If you adjust any settings, you will need to re-add the entry. Note that if you change the name of the Header or Total, and you add the entry, the previous entry will not be removed or replaced. The settings will only be updated if you leave the name the same as the previous entry, and then add the entry. 

Rows and Columns To Use Edit Box: Displays the row(s) and/or column(s) that you plan on using as the header or total for the currently selected region in the Region To Use list box. The information in this edit box will default to being the active cell or the selected cells. You can manually change this to use discontinuous rows for headers or totals. For example, you may want to use row 3, then row 5, then row 10 as header information for the currently selected region. You can also specify rows or columns in a different worksheet if desired. 

Use Selected Cells Button: Allows you to reset the Rows and Columns To Use edit box to the active cell or the selected cells. 

Monitor Cells: This dialog allows you to setup a single cell, or group of cells, you want to monitor (ALT-SHIFT-M by default). You can monitor them manually or they can be set up to speak automatically whenever they change. As you TAB through the Monitor Cells dialog, you will discover the following controls: 

Name Edit Box: Allows you to enter a description of the monitor cells group you are about to define. This name is only for documentation purposes, and has no impact on the functionality of the item being defined. The name can also be spoken when the monitor cell is spoken, and will also be displayed in the Monitor Names list box when the "Any monitor cell" hotkey is pressed. 

Cells To Monitor Edit Box: Displays cells to be monitored, and defaults to being either the active cell or range of currently selected cells. You may also enter monitor cells manually, using a single cell position, a collection of cells separated by a comma, or a range of cells separated by a colon. You can also supply the worksheet name. For example, you might enter something like: 

a1,b1,c5:d10,sheet2!a1,sheet2!b5:sheet2!c10 

Note that it is important to make sure all punctuation is correct when entering cell collections or cell ranges. If you do not specify the worksheet name, the current worksheet will be used. 


Hotkey Combo Box: Allows you to select an ID (ranging from 1 to 10) to apply to the current group of monitor cells. The ID is only used when you press the associated Monitor Cell hot key (Monitor Cell 1 through Monitor Cell 10, discussed below). If you do not wish to read the defined monitor cells using any of the 10 read monitor cells hotkeys, meaning you set it up to read automatically or you will use the any monitor cell hotkey, then you can set this to none. Doing so will cause Window-Eyes not to attach this monitor cell to any of the 10 read monitor cell hotkeys. 

Name Check Box (Default: Unchecked) � With this option enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the name supplied in the Name edit box before speaking the monitor cell data. 

Row Header Check Box (Default: Unchecked) � With this option enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the row header (if defined) before speaking the monitor cell data. 

Column Header Check Box (Default: Unchecked) � With this option enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the column header (if defined) before speaking the monitor cell data. 

Position Check Box (Default: Checked): With this option enabled, Window-Eyes will speak the cell position before speaking the monitor cell data. 

Auto Speak Check Box (Default: Unchecked): With this option enabled, Window-Eyes will automatically speak the monitor cell when its content changes. The monitor cell hot keys will always read regardless of whether or not this option is enabled. If the monitor cell group contains more than one cell, only the cell or cells that change will be read automatically within the group. 

Get Dependent Cells From Edit Box: Defaults to the active cell position or the selected cells. You can type any cell, collection, or range like the Cells To Monitor edit box. This control is useful for the following list box. 

Dependencies For List Box: Displays all cells that are dependencies for the cells listed in the Get Dependent Cells From edit box discussed above. For example, if you have a list of numbers from cell A1 to cell A10 and cell A11 is the sum of cell A1 through cell A10, and cell A5 was the active cell when accessing the monitor cell dialog, cell A5 will be in the Get Dependent Cells From edit box, and cell A11 will be in the Dependencies For list box. You can type any cell, collection, or range like the Cells To Monitor edit box. 

Add Selected Dependencies Button: Allows you to add the selected item in the Dependencies For list box to the Cells To Monitor edit box. If monitor cell information already exists in the Cells To Monitor edit box when pressing this button, the selected item in the Dependencies For list box will be appended to the text in the Cell To Monitor edit box. Note that this button will be disabled if you have not selected any items in the Dependencies list box. 

The Get Dependant Cells from edit box, Dependencies for list box and the Add Selected Dependencies button are tools which allow you to easily setup monitor cells for cells that are dependent on other cells, and will list the dependent cells for the active or selected cells. You can also use these tools like a calculator to get any dependencies you wish. 

Add Entry Button: Saves all current data to the list of Monitor Names for the current worksheet. The dialog will remain open after selecting this button. 

Remove Entry Button: Removes the currently selected item in the Monitor Names list box, and associated data, for the current worksheet. The dialog will remain open after selecting this button. 

OK Button: Automatically saves all current data to the list of Monitor Names for the current worksheet, and closes the dialog. 

Cancel Button: Closes the dialog without saving the current entry. 

Monitor Names List Box: Lists all the names of the monitored groups currently defined, and allows you to arrow between them. As you move through them all the other controls will update to their settings. This can be used to review or update settings for existing groups. 

The Monitor Cells dialog allows you to easily set up a quick monitor cell by automatically setting the name to Quick # (where # is the first unused Read Monitor hot key. If there is no unused hot key, the name will be left blank), the Cells To Monitor will default to the active cell (or current selection), and only the position check box will be checked. This quick feature can be used if you are on a single cell or selection of cells that you wish to monitor. Simply bring up the Monitor Cells dialog, note the default name given, and press enter. The quick monitor group will be saved automatically. The name indicates the number of the Read Monitor Cell hot key to use. This feature provides you with a way to monitor a cell or group of cells quickly, without having to set up a number of options. 

Monitor Cell 1-10: Each of these 10 hot keys will read the monitor cell with the respective ID (ALT-SHIFT-0 through ALT-SHIFT-9 by default). In other words, Monitor Cell 1 will read the monitor cell whose ID is 1. Monitor Cell 2 will read the monitor cell whose ID is 2, and so on. Note that multiple monitor cells can be associated with the same ID. 

Any Monitor Cell: This hot key activates the Read Monitor Cell dialog, which allows you to select which monitor cell you want to read (ALT-SHIFT-A by default). As you TAB through the dialog, you will discover the following controls: 


Monitored Cells List Box: Lists all defined monitor cells. 

Speak Data Button: Allows Window-Eyes to read the selected monitor cell in the Monitored Cells List Box. 

Cancel: Closes the dialog. 

While in the list of monitor cells, you can press ENTER to have Window-Eyes read the information for the selected monitor cell. Focus will stay in the list so that you can arrow to a different monitor cell without having to TAB back to the list. 

* Read Total Cell: This hot key will automatically read the total cell defined in the Headers and Totals dialog (ALT-SHIFT-T by default). If a total cell is not defined, Window-Eyes will look for all dependent cells of the active cell that have a formula starting with �=SUM�, and will read them automatically. 
* Read Comment: This hot key will read the comment for the active cell (ALT-SHIFT-C by default). 
* Read Formula When pressed once, this hot key will read the formula for the active cell (ALT-SHIFT-F by default). When pressed twice, this hot key will spell the formula for the active cell. 
* Previous Cell: This hot key will move focus back to the cell that was active before the current cell became active (ALT-SHIFT-P by default). 

#### Miscellaneous Hot Keys 

* F2: This is an Excel hot key that allows you to edit the current cell. When pressed, Window-Eyes will speak "edit mode." Press ESC to get out of edit mode. You will also hear �edit mode� if you start typing in data in any cell. 
* Mouse To Focus (INS-NUMPAD-PLUS by default) � When pressed, Window-Eyes will route the mouse to the center of the active cell or selected object. 
* Field Name (CTRL-SHIFT-N by default) � When pressed, Window-Eyes will read the position of the active cell. If a defined header is found, only the defined header will be read. If there is no defined header, the cell position will be read. The second press of this hot key will always read the cell position, along with any defined header. 
* Field Data (CTRL-SHIFT-D by default) � When pressed, Window-Eyes will read the data of the active cell. The second press will spell the contents. The third press will spell the contents phonetically. 
* CTRL-PAGE UP/CTRL-PAGE DOWN � Excel hot keys that move forward and backward through the worksheets of the current workbook. By default, the new worksheet name will be read, followed by the active cell. 
* Speak Summary (CTRL-SHIFT-S by default) � When pressed once, Window-Eyes will speak the cell information using the current verbosity options. When pressed a second time, Speak Summary will speak cell information forcing all verbosity options on for the current worksheet (note that only those elements that exist will be spoken). If a header has been defined for the active cell, speak summary will read the header. If there is no header and the location verbosity check box is checked, then the current cell will be read. You can choose to hear info relative to the worksheet or workbook via the verbosity option. 
* Highlighted Block (CTRL-SHIFT-M by default) � When pressed, Window-Eyes will speak the range of cells that are selected, as well as which cell is currently active. For example, if cells A5 through H11 are selected, and A5 is the active cell, Window-Eyes will say, "Selected A5 to H11, active cell A5." The second press will provide more information about the selection. In the same example above you would hear, �Selected A5 to H11, A5 blah, H5 blah, A11 blah, H11 blah 7 rows 8 columns, active cell A5,� where �blah� is the cell�s contents. Note that if a cell is blank, then the cell is not read on the second press. Also, if a defined header is set up for any of the cells being read, the header will be spoken. 

#### Document specific settings

Window-Eyes now supports the ability to save specific settings for a specific worksheet using the Document Specific Settings feature located in the File menu of the Window-Eyes Voice Control panel, just like you can for Microsoft Word documents. Whenever you setup headers or totals, or monitor cells, these settings are automatically saved for the current worksheet for the current workbook, and are saved in the document specific settings. Also, as with Microsoft Word, you will be able to import and export document specific settings. 

#### Chart Navigation 

When you focus any chart, you can use Excel to navigate the chart elements by using the up and down arrows to move by major groups, and the left and right arrow keys to move within a group. Window-Eyes will automatically read the information as you navigate. You will, however, be able to obtain much more information about the current chart element by using the Element Properties dialog (INS-E by default). This dialog will provide information relative to the focused element on the chart. If the main chart itself (the chart area) is selected, all information about the chart will be provided. 

### Mozilla Firefox 

Window-Eyes 5.5 is the first screen reader to fully support Mozilla Firefox. Firefox is a free, open source, web browser developed by the Mozilla Foundation and hundreds of volunteers. Some of the major features that make Firefox an attractive alternative web browser are: 

* Tabbed Browsing: Open several pages in a single window, allowing you quick access to multiple pages of information. Tabbed browsing makes setting up travel plans, researching information, or reading news much more efficient. You can also load new links in the background so they're ready to be viewed when you're ready to read them. 
* Popup Blocking: A built in popup blocker keeps unwanted windows from being displayed 
* Privacy and Security: No ActiveX controls are loaded, and you can choose to have Firefox clear private data (such as browsing history, saved form information, passwords, cookies, cache, etc.) either on startup or shutdown. 
* Smarter Search: Google search is built into the Firefox toolbar, allowing you quick access to the most popular search engine. You can also customize searching capabilities by adding keywords to any search edit box. 
* Live Bookmarks: RSS integration lets you view news and headlines from your favorite sites. 
* Download Manager: Keep all your downloads organized in one place. 

For more information on all Firefox features, visit the Mozilla Firefox web page: http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/. 

Window-Eyes support for Firefox is almost identical to that of Internet Explorer. In other words, all of the quick access keys, detailed in Section 19 of the Window-Eyes manual, will work in both Firefox and Internet Explorer. In other words, regardless of the browser, C will move you through form controls, S will move you through lists. L will move you through links, and so on. 

You can find information on where to download Firefox at http://www.gwmicro.com/support/firefox. 

#### Accessible DHTML 

Accessible DHTML (Dynamic HyperText Markup Language) is now possible thanks to GW Micro's partnership with IBM and the Mozilla Foundation. Dynamic HTML is designed for applications that are developed to work through the browser. DHTML applications are treated just like stand alone Windows applications. In other words, we don't want you to realize the difference between using a dialog in a browser application and using a standard windows dialog. Window-Eyes provides complete access to controls like treeviews, combo boxes, progress bars, radio buttons, check boxes, etc., to ensure a seamless and productive environment, whether online or offline. 

Corporations like AOL, Yahoo, Oracle, and Peoplesoft have all expressed great interest in supporting Accessible DHTML in their future web applications, and GW Micro and IBM are working hard to guarantee DHTML accessibility. 

#### Hot Keys 

* CTRL-PAGE UP/CTRL-PAGE DOWN: Allows you to move forward and backward, respectively, through currently open tabs. 
* CTRL-1 through CTRL-0: Allows you to select the tab corresponding to the number pressed. In other words, to activate the 5th tab, press CTRL-5. To activate the 3rd tab, press CTRL-3. 
* CTRL-T: Opens a new tab, and places focus in the location edit box. 
* CTRL-K: Focuses the search edit box (the Google search engine is used by default) 
* CTRL-ENTER: Opens a link in a new tab in the background. 
* ALT-ENTER: When using the address bar, or search bar, this hot key will cause the results to be opened in a new tab in the background 
* ALT-D/CTRL-L: Focuses the address bar. 
* ALT-HOME: Sets the current tab to the defined home page. 
* CTRL-R: Reloads the current tab. 

Additional hot keys can be found in the Firefox help menu. 

### Misc. Features 

* In an effort to provide the best possible computing experience for new users, the Window-Eyes Voice Control Panel has been improved in a few different ways. 
	* Menu Level - Under the Global menu, you will find a new option called Menu Level that lets you choose between a simple menu system (designed for beginners), an advanced menu system (designed for advanced users), or a menu system that is in between. 
		* M = Menu Level � Default = Beginner 
		* Choosing Menu Level opens the Select Menu Level dialog box. The box contains a list with the following items. 
			* Beginner 
			* Intermediate 
			* Advanced 
		* When Menu Level is set to Beginner, the Window-Eyes Voice Control panel menu system will be stripped down to the basic functions a beginner might be interested in (such as voice settings, synthesizer, and Braille display). The Window-Eyes title bar will also change, only showing the name Window-Eyes (the active and associated set file information is not announced). When Menu Level is set to Intermediate, the Window-Eyes Voice Control panel menu system will be stripped down to the functions an intermediate user might be interested in (such as verbosity, punctuation, and dictionary editing). The Window-Eyes title bar will also change, only showing the name of the active set file (the associated set file information is not announced). When Menu Level is set to Advanced, all Window-Eyes menu options will be available. The Window-Eyes title bar will also change, showing the names of both the active set file, and associated set file. 
		* Note that menu level setting does not affect whether or not an unlisted feature still functions. In other words, when the menu level is set to beginner, the Verbosity menu is not available. But you may still access verbosity options by using the Verbosity Dialog hot key (INS-V by default). 
	* Global Options - The Window-Eyes global options for voice, rate, pitch, tone, and volume for screen, keyboard, and mouse are no longer available in the global menu, but are now always available under the Screen, Keyboard, and Mouse menus. The same is true for the verbosity options; they are no longer available in the global menu, but are now always available under the Verbosity menu item (when the menu level is set to Intermediate or Advanced). Global voice parameters and verbosity options still exist, and are still enabled or disabled using the Global Settings option in the global menu (note that Menu Level must be set to Advanced to adjust the Global Settings). There is no longer an Apply Settings option in the global menu. Instead, whenever you save ANY set file, Window-Eyes will automatically apply your verbosity settings at the same time. In other words, you would use the Screen menu to change the rate of speech, and then use File, Save, Save Set File to "apply" those settings. If the Menu Level is set to beginner, and a set file has not been associated to the current application where settings are being saved, Window-Eyes will create a new set file automatically using a default set file name (based on the current application), and will automatically associate it without prompting the user. If the Menu Level is set to Intermediate or Advanced, the Save As dialog will be displayed, allowing you to modify the name of the set file being saved. This set up allows beginner users to easily save both the current set file settings, and global settings, in one step, even if a set file does not already exist for an application. 
	* The Init Synthesizer option has been removed from the general menu, as this feature is not needed much anymore. We have, however, left in the ability to press the letter "i" while in the Window-Eyes Voice Control panel to initialize your synthesizer should you need to. Also, the Screen Redraw hot key (INS-BACKSLASH by default) will reinitialize your synthesizer. 
* Window-Eyes in the System Tray � The file menu includes a new option that will allow you to place Window-Eyes in the system tray, out of the ALT-TAB program list, allowing you quicker access to your open applications. Note that this feature is only available in Windows 2000 or greater. 
	* I = Run in System Tray � Default = Off 
	* This option will place a Window-Eyes icon in the system tray when you close the Window-Eyes Voice Control panel. You can still access the Window-Eyes Voice Control panel by using the Menu hot key (CTRL-BACKSLASH by default), by clicking the icon with the mouse (using either the left mouse button, right mouse button, or appropriate keystroke), or (if you're using Windows XP or greater) by pressing WINDOWS KEY-B, arrowing to the Window-Eyes icon, and either pressing ENTER, the context menu key, or SHIFT-F10. 
* Route to Tooltips: Window-Eyes now allows you to route the mouse pointer to a tooltip. This feature is extremely useful when a balloon tool tip pops up in the system tray saying something like, "Click here to perform a task." For example, if you have automatic updates turned on under Windows XP, when updates are available, a balloon tool tip may pop up in the system tray saying, "Updates for your computer have been downloaded from Windows Update. Click here to review these updates and install them." When you hear this message, press the Mouse to Focus hot key (INS-NUMPAD-PLUS by default) twice. Window-Eyes will say, "Pointer routed to tool tip," and will place the mouse pointer in the center of the tool tip. At that point, you can press the Single Click Left Button (NUMPAD-SLASH by default) to perform the click that the balloon refers to. 
* Auto Complete: When using Eudora, Outlook XP and 2003, or Outlook Express, Window-Eyes will now automatically read auto completed text in the email fields. Auto completion happens when you enter the first few characters of a name that exists in your address book, and the email program recognizes the text as being part of an address book entry. The applications mentioned above will automatically display the rest of the address that corresponds to the text that you've entered. For example, say you have wesupport@aisquared.com in your Eudora address book. If you create a new message in Eudora, and enter "su" in the To field, Eudora will automatically fill in the rest of the email address that matches what you've typed (in this case, pport@gwmicro.com). Window-Eyes will now automatically read the information that the email program has displayed (again, in this case, pport@gwmicro.com), as that is the text that Eudora has used to auto complete the email. You can press the Speak Summary hot key (CTRL-SHIFT-S by default) or speak current line (CTRL-NUMPAD-CENTER by default) to hear the entire email address. If you press Speak Summary twice, the email address will be spelled out. 
* Sonar: Window-Eyes now supports the appropriate MSAA events that allow Sonar 4 and Sonar 5 to speak automatically when navigating through the track view items, such as Manual Mute, Solo, Record, Volume, Pan, Volume Trim, Phase, Input, Output To, etc. In order for the proper MSAA events to fire, you will need to run one of the following registry files: 
	* For Sonar 4: wineyessetssonarsonar4.reg 
	* For Sonar 5: wineyessetssonarsonar5.reg 
	* Either type the full path to the registry file of your choice in the run dialog in the Windows start menu (followed by enter), or select the appropriate file through Windows explorer (followed by enter). Make sure that Sonar is not running when you run either registry file. 

### Enhancements between Window-Eyes 5.5 and Window-Eyes 5.0 

### Browse Mode 

In an effort to clear up the mystery behind what MSAA mode actually is, we are no longer calling it MSAA mode. Window-Eyes now refers to the environment used for browsing web pages, PDF documents, HTML help, HTML emails, etc., as browse mode. Note that the functionality of browsing has not changed; we have simply changed the name to provide users with a better understanding of what this environment is used for. When you're in browse mode (formerly known as MSAA mode), CTRL-SHIFT-A is still the default toggle key, and when pressed, will announce, "browse on" or "browse off." And Browse mode, just like MSAA mode, needs to be off before you can interact with edit boxes, and similar form controls. All hot keys that worked in MSAA mode are exactly the same in Browse mode, and can be found under the Hot Keys dialog, in a section called Browse mode. Once again, functionality has not changed. We have only changed the name of this mode to help provide a clear understanding of its purpose. 

### Microsoft Word 

* Next/Prev Sentence � We have added two new hot keys for moving to the previous (CTRL-SHIFT-PAGE UP) and next (CTRL-SHIFT-PAGE DOWN) sentences in Microsoft Word. Microsoft Word does not define the next/previous sentences hot keys by default, so we added them to the Normal template automatically when Word starts. 
* Tab controls in the Page Setup dialog in Word were not reading when focused. This has been resolved. 
* Controls created using Word Macro forms were not being read. This has been resolved. 
* Some Word documents caused Window-Eyes to become sluggish when opened. This has been resolved. 
* Next and Previous line hot keys would cause lockups in types of documents. This has been resolved. 
* We have enhanced form support for Word. Forms should now be much faster and more reliable. 
* We fixed a problem where Braille output would show "re" while in the document area in Word. 
* If you type Janu, Word will pop up a tool tip saying to press ENTER to automatically complete the word January. Window-Eyes now reads these tool tips. 
* We fixed a problem where pressing ESC to cancel a read to end could cause lock ups when using Word under Windows 9X. 
* We fixed a problem where enhanced apostrophes (ANSI 146) would cause words like "don't" to be spoken "don t." This correction affects any application that uses this type of apostrophe. 
* Window-Eyes now includes alternative text for graphics in the page navigation dialog. 
* Window-Eyes now allows check boxes and radio buttons to be toggled inside of protected documents. 
* Thanks to our feedback to Microsoft, they have resolved more issues on their side, so make sure that you have all of the latest Microsoft Office updates from the Microsoft web site. 
* We fixed a problem where the file name edit box would not speak correctly in Word 2000. 
* Characters were not being read in the spellchecker in Word. This has been resolved. 
* Tabbing between the toolbar items in Microsoft Office is now much more responsive. 

### Internet Explorer 

* In Internet Explorer, the left and right arrow keys would not read form titles correctly. This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes now works much better with IFRAMES on web pages. 
* We have resolved several list issues. 
* We fixed a problem where moving through anchors on web pages was inconsistent. 
* On some web pages, onClicks would disappear when you navigated away from the page, and then back. This has been resolved. 
* We fixed a problem where tabbing through links on some pages would cause the page to reload. 
* We fixed a problem where same page links were not working on some pages. 
* Window-Eyes was incorrectly reporting foreground and background colors in the element properties dialog. This has been resolved. 
* The element properties dialog was listing foreground and background colors in RGB format rather than using color names. This has been resolved. 
* We fixed a problem where selecting text in MSAA mode would cause additional characters to be selected, even after being unselected. 
* Smart Table mode was ignoring form controls when determining whether a table should be announced or not. This has been resolved. 
* On some web pages, Window-Eyes would place protected text (such as "end frame") at the beginning of the next line of text. This has been resolved. 
* The fieldset verbosity option was being ignored. This has been resolved. 
* Quotes and Blockquotes now use the same verbosity option 
* The "refresh blocked" and "redirect blocked" messages are now forced on, regardless of the new page information verbosity setting, and are the first messages spoken after a load done message when a new page has a refresh or redirect that has been blocked. 
* We fixed a problem where Window-Eyes would not put the cursor on an edit box when pressing ENTER on the control. 
* We fixed a problem where font information was being provided for images in the element properties dialog. 
* If an onClick existed on a given element, all child elements would also have onClicks associated with them. This has been resolved. 
* We fixed a problem where protected text (such as "list 1 with 4 items") would be selected when using the SHIFT-ARROW keys. 
* The headings on some pages were not being indicated. This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes now provides access to hidden edit boxes, such as search boxes located inside drop down menu items. 
* We fixed several list problems with Macromedia Flash movies. 
* We have added support for the current beta of Internet Explorer 7.

* We resolved a problem where messages in Outlook would just say, "loading page" or would ding when pressing the down arrow after loading a new message. 
* In Outlook 2003, when you opened a new message, you would hear the title of the previous message being read. This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes now supports the Outlook 2003 auto complete feature. 
* We resolved a crash that would happen when opening email in Outlook Express. 

### Browse Mode 

* Browse Mode would not always reload automatically after pressing enter on a button on a web page. This has been resolved. 
* Browse Mode would not reload automatically after sending a message in Outlook Express. This has been resolved. 
* We have added a new Browse Mode link verbosity option: Do Not Indicate Link/Indicate Link Before/Indicate Link After � This option will notify the user of link elements. If Do Not Indicate Link is enabled, no link indication will be announced. If Indicate Link Before is enabled, the link announcement will be spoken before the link text. For example, "Link GW Micro." If Indicate Link After is enabled, the link announcement will be spoken after the link text. For example, "GW Micro Link." This option is also used when tabbing through links with browse mode turned off. 
* We fixed a problem where links spanning multiple lines would be broken up into individual lines in Browse Mode. 
* Window-Eyes would incorrectly indicate "redirect blocked." This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes would get stuck, saying, "downloading page." This has been resolved. 
* We fixed a problem where browse mode would not load correctly with multiple browse windows open.

* We fixed a crash when using Grade 2 Braille in certain cases. 
* We have added support for the Braille Sense Notetaker (serial and USB), Papenmeier Braillex EL 66s and 80s, Humanware Brailliant 32, 64, and 80 Braille displays. 
* Updated the default Braille keys for the Brailliant, SuperVario, and PocketVario displays.

* We fixed a problem where Braille was not visible in the command prompt under Windows 2000 or higher, and some 16-bit applications. 
* BrailleNote with full keyboard support has been added to the list of supported Braille displays. 

### Lotus Notes 

* We fixed a problem where Window-Eyes was not able to locate the document/database link icon in both new and existing messages. 
* Window-Eyes now reads event list boxes correctly. 
* When arrowing through a message, Window-Eyes could triple speak certain lines. This has been resolved. 
* The open database list box was not speaking. This has been resolved. 
* We fixed a problem where message status graphics (read, unread, etc.) were not always reading. 
* Browse mode was not being activated when opening the first message. This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes now automatically determines the version of Notes being used rather than relying on an INI file.

* We fixed some major OSM corruption when using Excel. This fix also affects other applications using the same method to put data on the screen. 
* Window-Eyes could lose information in newly launched applications. This has been resolved. 
* When Window-Eyes is running and a screen saver that requires a password comes up, the system could lock. This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes could max out the CPU under specific circumstances. This has been resolved. 
* We have fixed several reports submitted via the Window-Eyes Error Reporting utility. Thanks to everyone who continues to use this utility to report problems. You help make Window-Eyes a better product! 
* Several blow ups and memory leaks have been resolved. 
* We have made several low level changes that should greatly impact Window-Eyes performance. General usage should appear to be much faster.

### Misc. Enhancements 

* Window-Eyes now has preliminary support for the beta versions of Windows Vista. Note that XP video drivers are required for Window-Eyes to work successfully under Windows Vista betas. 
* Top and Bottom index were not spoken when a Windows Explorer folder view was set to list under Windows 2K/XP. This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes now reads an index number in MSAA tab controls. 
* When switching between two applications that use browse mode (such as Eudora, and Lotus Notes), sometimes browse mode would not come back on automatically. This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes was speaking the checked status, as well as "on/off" for the check boxes in the Start Menu customization dialog. This has been resolved, and will now only speak on or off. 
* A portion of the text manual was missing. This has been resolved. 
* We have resolved the "Cannot Create Hook" message that showed up after a recent security update from Microsoft under Windows 9X. 
* Window-Eyes now speaks the tool tips in Skype. 
* The text "blink" was not being localized for other languages. This has been resolved. 
* We fixed a problem when switching identities in Outlook Express with the preview pane enabled. 
* We fixed a problem where browse mode would not always turn on automatically in Eudora. 
* MSN Messenger 7 would crash when exiting Window-Eyes. This has been resolved, and helped fix a major shutdown problem that Window-Eyes had. 
* Trackbars in MSN Messenger 7 were not reading. This has been resolved. 
* When you press the speak summary hotkey, if a field name is associated with the control that currently has focus, it will now be read. For example, before this fix, while on the combo edit box in the run dialog Window-Eyes would say "blah x of y" where blah is the current text in the combo edit box. Now we say "open o blah x of y". 
* Window-Eyes was not indicating the check box status in some applications. This has been resolved. 
* There were a handful of applications (such as MDaemon, and Sygate) where Window-Eyes was not able to read menus, or context menus. This has been resolved. 
* Menu accelerators were not being reported for some Windows menus as well as most (if not all) MSAA menus. This has been resolved. 
* We have increased the limit on manual field name labels (created with CTRL-INS-F by default) from 48 characters to 200. 
* Window-Eyes would not check to see if a particular window was in the Off Screen Model before setting system caret information for it. 
* Read Current Line would occasionally pick up old line information. This has been resolved. 
* We have made several improvements for the next version of AOL. 
* Window-Eyes fully supports MSN Messenger 7.5 
* When word mode was enabled, apostrophes would not be sent to the synthesizer. This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes now correctly reads the View, and Arrange Icons context menu, and will indicate when items are checked. 
* When arrowing past the first screen of text in Outlook, Window-Eyes would no longer announce blank lines, and would read previous lines in place of blank lines. This has been resolved. 
* If the system tray gets focus, Window-Eyes will make sure that the mouse pointer is not in the system tray � this helps reading accuracy when focus is in the system tray. 
* Window-Eyes no longer double reads tool tips as you move from entry to entry in the quick launch, task bar, or system tray. 
* If you were using an enhanced apostrophe (ANSI 146), Window-Eyes would break up the word the apostrophe was used in. This was most notable in Word with the "Straight Quotes" with "Smart Quotes" replace-as-you-type feature enabled. This has been resolved. 
* You can now apply different speech parameters to individual SAPI and ViaVoice synthesizers. In other words, if you want to use ETI Eloquence Reed with a voice rate of 50, but want to hear ETI Eloquence Grandma at rate 35, you can. The Use Engine Specific Specified Speech Parameters check box in the Select Synthesizer dialog allows different speech parameters to be applied to each SAPI and ViaVoice engine installed. Note that the Use Specified Speech Parameters check box must be checked to enable this feature. If you do not specify parameters for a specific engine, the parameters will revert to the specified parameters for SAPI or ViaVoice, depending upon which one you are using. If no specific parameters have been specified for the engines globally, then Window-Eyes will revert to the settings in individual set files, either global or local, depending upon what you are using. 
* The wefixset utility has been updated. This is what the installer uses to update your sets. Also you have updated set2text and text2set utilities. 
* Window-Eyes no longer allows access to File dialog (such as open, close, save, and save as) when you're sitting at the Windows login screen. We disable these menu items due to security reasons to prevent people from overwriting files or exploring the file system. 
* We fixed a problem where Window-Eyes would chop off the first letter of each item in the Duxbury status line. 
* Window-Eyes would read incorrect menu items in Notepad when text was selected. This has been resolved. 
* MSN Messenger 7.5 contact list items were reading multiple items. This has been resolved. 
* We fixed a problem where text entered in the Visual Studio .NET code area was not speaking. 
* Window-Eyes would speak "tree view" or "outline button" too often in MSN Messenger 7.5. This has been resolved. 
* Window-Eyes could miss events (such as window creations) when applications were opened. 
* Eudora's Microsoft Viewer would say, "Loading page" when you pressed the down arrow too quickly. This has been resolved. 
* We have increased supported lengths for name, value, and description fields in MSAA events and queries. 
* Window-Eyes now supports the Windows XP Media Edition Media Center application. 
* You can now specify which sound card to use for the DECtalk Access32. This new feature works for both the full DECtalk Access 32 as well as the DECtalk Access 32 (Window-Eyes) version. When you have either synthesizer selected, you can tab to a combo box that lets you select the default card, the first card, second card, and so on. Note that this change may cause your existing speech parameters to be reset to the default settings. 
* We have resolved several context menu problems, specifically in the Word XP file/open dialog, Windows Explorer, AdAware, and Skype. 
* Up-down controls were not speaking label or contents in Microsoft Word. This has been resolved. 
* We fixed a problem where Window-Eyes hot keys would stop working. 
* The verbosity dialog would sometimes open up in the wrong group. This has been resolved. 
* Braille would not refresh in some situations. This has been resolved. 
* In Word, the first letter of a list item would not speak. This has been resolved. 
* We have added Word and Excel support for the current beta of Office 12. 
* The control tabs in the Services control panel would double speak. This has been resolved. 
* In Eudora, the first letter of some lines in Eudora would not being read when using the left and right arrow keys. This has been resolved. 
* An error would occur if MSCONFIG was closed while Window-Eyes was running under Windows 9X/Me. This has been resolved. 
* The Window-Eyes help/about dialog how shows if a copy is a Lease to Own, Evaluation, Dongle, or Everlocked copy. 
* Window-Eyes now supports the ability to be installed during a remote session (i.e. Citrix, Terminal Services, or Remote Desktop). 
* Window-Eyes offers a Video Support install, and a Window-Eyes Mobile install for creating a portable installation of Window-Eyes on a removable drive, such as a USB Flash drive. More information can be found in Section 2.11 of the Window-Eyes Manual. 

### Set File Updates 

* Eudora 
	* Field names have been manually set in the help and register dialogs. 
	* Sponsored Mode, Paid Mode, and Light Mode graphics labeled. 
	* Labeled checked/unchecked graphics for Eudora install program. 
	* Added key label "out box" for CTRL-0. 
* Internet Explorer 
	* Context Sensitive help has been updated. 
	* The status line hotkey is now consistent between IE and Firefox. 
	* In order for these changes to take effect, you will need to re-install the Internet Explorer set files using the Select Set File dialog in the File menu of Window-Eyes. 
	* Changed the next / prior frame hot keys to M and SHIFT-M. 
* Firefox 
	* New Firefox sets have been added 
* Outlook 2000 
	* Conversation Graphics have been added. 
* Outlook 2003 
	* Added hyperactive window to reload main set file 
	* Added new cursor keys: 
* Office 
	* We have removed ALT-S from reading the status line in the Outlook 2003 set files, because ALT-S is the Outlook send key. The Window-Eyes status line hot key (CTRL-INS-S by default) will read the status line. 
	* Labels for message headers were not speaking correctly when replying to messages in Outlook 2003. The sets have been modified to remove the manual field labels for To, CC, BCC, and Message Area. This is fixed for Outlook 2K, XP and 2003. 
	* Microsoft Office Outlook repeats 3 times when launched - This does require that you update your sets with our factory sets. This fix also makes it cleaner for Outlook 2K and Outlook XP. 
	* In order for these changes to take effect, you will need to re-install the Office 2003 set files using the Select Set File dialog in the File menu of Window-Eyes. 
	* Graphic labels for the Word Art dialog has been added for Word 2003. 
* Outlook Express 
	* News thread graphics labeled. 
	* Labeled more read/unread graphics. 
* Lotus Notes 
	* The readme file for the Lotus Notes sets has been updated. 
	* The set files are now called NOTES instead of NOTES5, as they support versions of Notes greater than 5. 
* Microsoft Excel 2000 
	* The Excel 2000 sets have been completely redone. 
* Microsoft Excel XP 
	* The Excel XP sets have been completely redone. 
* Microsoft Excel 2003 
	* The Excel 2003 sets have been completely redone. 
* Microsoft Word 2000 
	* Added CTRL-SHIFT-PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN to read sentence. 
* Microsoft Word XP 
	* Added CTRL-SHIFT-PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN to read sentence. 
* Microsoft Word 2003 
	* Added CTRL-SHIFT-PAGE UP/PAGE DOWN to read sentence. 
* Sonar 4/5 
	* Added two .reg files for MSAA support 
	* Updated readme with registry file information 
* Window-Eyes Defaults 
	* Labeled checked/unchecked graphics for Nullsoft installer applications 
	* Labeled checked/unchecked graphics for Installshield installer applications 
	* Fixed scroll up/scroll down graphics 
	* Associated wepunc.000 to the Window-Eyes element properties dialog forcing all punctuation on 
	* We have updated the default global setting for Browse Mode -> New Page Information, and Status Messages -- these options are now off by default globally. 
	* We have labeled additional checked/unchecked graphics in the Windows XP Add/Remove Windows Components dialog. 
	* In order for these changes to take effect, you will need to re-install the Window-Eyes Default set files using the Select Set File dialog in the File menu of Window-Eyes. Because re-installing the Window-Eyes Default set files effects the WINEYES.000 set file currently in use, you will need to shut down Window-Eyes and re-launch it after re-installing the Window-Eyes Default set files in order for the new set file changes to take effect. 
* Misc. 
	* We've added Accupos Point of Sale sets, Groupwise sets, and have updated the Goldwave sets. Thanks to Richard Turner for all of these set files 
	* Converted MSAA to Browse Mode in readme files, and context sensitive help for all set files. 

# 5.0
Released: 1/19/2005

Cost: $75

Welcome to Window-Eyes 5.0 

Congratulations! 

Your productivity just got better. Thanks to the revolutionary power of Window-Eyes 5.0, with new support for Microsoft Word, and an innovative color identification feature (not to mention the existing robust features of Window-Eyes, like powerful, W3C compliant web access with Internet Explorer), you now have the power to be more successful at work, at school, and at home. 

### Word Specific Features 

The following section deals with the specific Word features that Window-Eyes 5.0 now supports. As you will see, there are many new features available. 

#### The Microsoft Word DOM (Document Object Model) 

Window-Eyes 5.0 offers 100% text accuracy, 100% of the time thanks to the use of the Microsoft Word DOM. The DOM (Document Object Model) allows Window-Eyes to communicate directly with Word, insuring that the text you hear is exactly the same text in your document. This is a first in the screen reader industry. 

#### Microsoft Word Hotfixes 

Thanks to our working relationship with Microsoft, we now offer the most stable, feature-rich support for Word. During our development cycle, we found a few Word bugs that affected all users of the Microsoft Word DOM. Microsoft has released several hotfixes to resolve these bugs, and we are helping to distribute them, since they benefit all screen reader users. We believe it's important � and responsible � not only to provide our own bug fixes, but to help you update the software we all rely on. For more information on obtaining the latest versions of Microsoft Word, and the latest hotfixes, please visit http://www.gwmicro.com/support/office. 

* Columns - Columns are commonly used in newspapers, magazines, and multi-pane layouts. Window-Eyes will restrict reading to the current column, rather than letting text from each column bleed through on a single line. This has long been a problem for many screen readers. 
* Fields - Fields are textual placeholders used for automatic generation of a specific type of element, such as document information, calculations, or even personal data on a job application. Window-Eyes can announce when you enter/leave fields, and count fields on the current line. 
* Headers / Footers / Page Numbers - Headers and footers provide page information outside the boundary of the main document. Headers appear at the top of a page, and footers appear at the bottom. They often include items such as page numbers, chapter titles, dates, and author names. Window-Eyes can announce headers, footers, and page numbers. 
* Miscellaneous Verbosity Window-Eyes can also indicate the following features and elements: 
	* Indicate AutoCorrect - Will indicate when a word has been auto-corrected by Microsoft Word. 
	* Indicate Borders and Shading: Will indicate when the cursor enters or leaves an area that has been styled with either a border or shading. 
	* Indicate Smart Tags: Will indicate when a word contains a Smart Tag. 
	* Indicate Styles: Will automatically speak the format style of the current element when moving from one style to the next. 
	* Automatically Dock Toolbars: To ensure that text is not hidden by any of Word's floating toolbars, Window-Eyes provides the option to dock the toolbars from the document area to the toolbar. 
* Pictures / Objects: Inline pictures and objects are elements that are positioned directly in the text of a document. Non-inline (or floating) pictures and objects are elements that have a fixed position regardless of the surrounding text or other elements. Window-Eyes can announce when the cursor encounters one of these pictures or objects. 
* References: Window-Eyes can read the following references: 
	* Comments: Comments are notes added to a document. The comments are usually displayed in balloon windows in the margin of the document area. 
	* Footnotes/Endnotes: Footnotes and endnotes are used to provide additional information (for example, further explanation, comments, or references) for specific text in a document. They're also used in some academic writing styles. 
	* Indicate References: Window-Eyes will announce when a reference is encountered, and will read the associated reference information. 
* Revisions: Revisions (or markup) contain changes such as insertions, deletions, and formatting changes that have been applied to an original document. Window-Eyes will announce when a revision is encountered and will read the associated revision text. It will also read the revision author's name, date, and number of revisions. 
* Sections: Sections are portions of a document which contain specific formatting options that differ from the rest of the document. For example, a document may begin with text in two columns, and end with text in three columns. Each group of columns would be considered a section. Window-Eyes will announce when the cursor enters a new section of a document. 
* Spelling / Grammar: When Window-Eyes finds a spelling or grammar error, it's possible to correct them "on the fly." Just press SHIFT-F10 to bring up a context menu with several options for the current error. Use the feature to count and indicate spelling and grammar errors. 
* Tables - Tables are displayed much like a spreadsheet, however they can be designed in a non-uniform way by merging cells. With other screen readers, reading keys may not work as expected in non-uniform tables, and navigation may be confusing. Window-Eyes can indicate whether a table contains non-uniform rows or non-uniform columns. In addition to the traditional tab/shift tab, there are several Window-Eyes hotkeys used to navigate through table cells 
* Element Properties: Window-Eyes can summarize the properties of a particular element, such as different format styles, including colors, fonts, and formatting (bold, underline, italic, etc.). 
* Page Navigation: The Page Navigation dialog provides the ability to quickly navigate through or review the components of a document in one comprehensive dialog. Window-Eyes will list all comments, hyperlinks, bookmarks, footnotes/endnotes, objects, revisions, form fields, and spelling and grammatical errors. 
* Additional Word Features 
	* Drop cap: Window-Eyes fully supports drop cap letters (initial characters of a word whose font size is significantly larger than the rest of the word) and will incorporate them seamlessly into their associated line. 
	* Vertical Text: Window-Eyes fully supports vertical text when reading by line, and will indicate if the text is presented from top to bottom or from bottom to top. 
	* Speak Summary has been enhanced to provide detailed information about the current document. 
	* Cursor Position Information: When using the Cursor Position hot key, Window-Eyes will speak the position to 1/100th of whatever unit Word has been configured to use. For example, if Word has been configured for inches, the Cursor Position hot key might read, �1.83 inches from left, 3.55 inches from top, page 8.� 
	* Insert vs. Overtype: Regardless of whether the dedicated INS key is pressed, or the INS key on the number pad is pressed, the insert and overtype modes will always be announced, and will always function properly. 
	* Format Alert: Window-Eyes can indicate offsets from the left margin of the current section. Window-Eyes can indicate if two or more spaces exist on a line, as well as tab spacing. For example, if a line contains, �This tab is space space a tab test,� Window-Eyes would announce, �This tab is 2 spaces a tab test.� 
	* Selecting text: In addition to 100% text accuracy 100% of the time, Window-Eyes also boasts 100% selected text accuracy 100% of the time, regardless of the selected text color. 
	* Document Specific Settings: Window-Eyes now supports the ability to save specific settings for specific documents using the Document Specific Settings feature. Currently, only Word documents are supported, and only field names can be saved per document. Additional settings will be able to be saved per document in future versions of Window-Eyes. 

### Color Dictionary 

Initially, Window-Eyes presented both foreground and background colors in an RGB (Red/Green/Blue) format that, although extremely accurate, was somewhat difficult to interpret without memorizing multiple combinations of colors. For example, one shade of red might be equal to r255,b0,g0, while another might be equal to r100,b10,g10. 

To remove the confusion of RGB values for both foreground and background colors, Window-Eyes 5.0 introduces a revolutionary color dictionary concept that not only indicates colors by names, but also indicates when an unknown color is close to the shade of a known color. For example, instead of reading r255,g0,b0 for the color red, Window-Eyes will now simply say, �red.� Instead of saying, r100,b10,g10, Window-Eyes will now say, �shade of red.� 

Like all other Window-Eyes dictionaries, the Window-Eyes Color Dictionary is completely customizable. Colors that have already been defined can be altered, and new colors can be added. For example, the color red could easily be defined as, �my favorite color.� Then, whenever Window-Eyes would encounter the color red, it would announce, �my favorite color.� This can be specific to individual programs and applications. 

The power of the Window-Eyes color dictionary becomes evident when you imagine scenarios where Window-Eyes might announce a color as being �shade of my favorite color� or �shade of important information,� such as an email program. 

### Mozilla 

Window-Eyes 5.0 is proud to be the first screen reader to include robust support for the Mozilla web browser, a popular alternative to Internet Explorer.
